# `pkggraph`

The package [`pkggraph`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkggraph) is meant to interactively explore various dependencies of a package(s) (on CRAN like repositories) and perform analysis using [tidy](http://tidyverse.org/) philosophy. Most of the functions return a [`tibble`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble) object (enhancement of `dataframe`) which can be used for further analysis. The package offers functions to produce [`network`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=network) and [`igraph`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=igraph) dependency graphs. The `plot` method produces a static plot based on [`ggnetwork`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggnetwork) and `plotd3` function produces an interactive D3 plot based on [`networkD3`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=networkD3).
