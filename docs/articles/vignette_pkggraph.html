      <p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
      The package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkggraph"><code>pkggraph</code></a> is meant to interactively explore various dependencies of a package(s) (on CRAN like repositories) and perform analysis using <a href="http://tidyverse.org/">tidy</a> philosophy. Most of the functions return a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble"><code>tibble</code></a> object (enhancement of <code>dataframe</code>) which can be used for further analysis. The package offers functions to produce <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=network"><code>network</code></a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=igraph"><code>igraph</code></a> dependency graphs. The <code>plot</code> method produces a static plot based on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggnetwork"><code>ggnetwork</code></a> and <code>plotd3</code> function produces an interactive D3 plot based on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=networkD3"><code>networkD3</code></a>.

<p>The package <code>pkggraph</code> aims to provide a consistent and intuitive platform to explore the dependencies of packages in CRAN like repositories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The package attempts to strike a balance between two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding characteristics of the repository, at repository level (relating to â€˜forestâ€™)</li>
<li>Discover relevant packages and their contribution (relating to â€˜treesâ€™)</li>
</ul>
<p>So that, we do not <em>see trees for the forest</em> nor <em>see only a forest</em> !</p>

<p>The important features of <code>pkggraph</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most functions return a three column <code>tibble</code> (<code>pkg_1</code>, <code>relation</code>, <code>pkg_2</code>). The first row in the table below indicates that <code>dplyr</code> package â€˜Importsâ€™ <code>assertthat</code> package.</li>

<ul>
<li>There are three function families:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>get</strong> family: These functions return a <code>tibble</code>. ex: <code>get_reverse_depends</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>neighborhood</strong> family: These functions return a <code>pkggraph</code> object containing a <code>network</code> or a <code>igraph</code> object. ex: <code>neighborhood_graph</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>relies</strong> family: These functions capture recursive dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
